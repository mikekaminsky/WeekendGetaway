# WeekendGetaway
An application for finding cheap long-weekend flights

ToDo:
* [x] Create general database connection class
*   [x] Create local PostgreSQL db for development
* [x] Create setup method to create new DB with the following tables:
  * [x] trips
  * [x] flights
  * [x] legs
* [ ] Create update method to add new trips, flights, and legs
* [ ] Create ruby app to display data from JSON
  * Not sure how to organize data?
    * [datatables](https://www.datatables.net/) is an option -- can use Kayak-style metadata to describe multiple-leg information.
